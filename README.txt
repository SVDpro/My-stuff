# My-stuff repository

Hello there! This is my first time using github and inserting files in it.
This project was my coursework on the subject called OOP. My theme was to make a Television program.
I know that this program is not ideal, but still you can use it as an example of how to make a simple TV program.
The Resource folder is missing a "video" folder with videos in it, but you can use whatever videos you want! Just don't forget to put them in the "video" folder and to copy their URL's and to put them to the txt file called "Channels.txt"!

Peace,
Daniel Chumak
